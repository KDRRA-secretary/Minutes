_The actual wording of the No Confidence motion at the meeting was a motion of ‘No Confidence in the Chair’ in a particular meeting. A vote of no confidence in the Chairperson is a motion when the organisation feels the Chairperson, an elected position, no longer has the confidence of the majority members of the organisation. Such a motion requires prior notice be given to all members—if the motion is carried the Chairperson must resign from the position, or is disposed. In both cases if the sitting chair is the object of the motion, they must step down; the Vice-Chairperson then presides over the vote, or some other person nominated by the meeting, there is no debate of the motion as  it is a procedural matter._
